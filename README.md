# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Bilel! 

## About Me

Iâ€™m a **Security Architect** with a passion for **Penetration Testing**. I enjoy uncovering vulnerabilities, solving challenging security puzzles, and learning something new every day.

Currently, Iâ€™m working on **OSCP PEN-200**. I post insights on [X (formerly Twitter)](https://x.com/Bilel_Here) about the labs I find challenging and how I overcome them. Itâ€™s been a humbling and rewarding journey of learning and growth so far.
