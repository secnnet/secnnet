## 🛡️ Profile  
I help teams catch threats early and deal with them quickly. My work covers SIEM, EDR/XDR, incident response, SOAR automation, and cloud & identity security. I like keeping things practical and human, not over-engineered.

## ✍️ About me  
I started my career in security engineering nearly a decade ago, working across global industries with IBM and later BlueVoyant before moving into senior detection engineering roles. I enjoy solving real problems with straightforward solutions. Outside of work, I train in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and Muay Thai, I like fishing, and I love playing chess. Coffee usually helps too.
